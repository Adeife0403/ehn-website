        <h2>My Lifeline During the Storm</h2>
        <p>
          Mr. and Mrs. Balogun may never fully understand what they did for me. When I stood on the edge of giving up, they stepped in — quietly, generously, and wholeheartedly. They didn’t ask for anything in return. They didn’t make a show of it. They simply saw a young student in need… and gave.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I couldn’t afford to sit for my WAEC exam — the test that would determine my future — they paid for it. That act may have taken just a moment for them, but it changed the entire direction of my life. Their belief in me carried a weight I’ll never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of them, I found the strength to keep going. I walked into that exam hall not just with a pen, but with the silent encouragement of two people who believed I was worth investing in. And because of that, I now walk a path where I can help others — just as they helped me.
        </p>
        <p>
          This tribute is for the unsung acts of kindness that ripple through generations.
          Thank you, Mr. & Mrs. Balogun. You are a part of my story forever.
