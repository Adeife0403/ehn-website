    <p>
      After my mother passed away, there were very few options for where my brother and I could go. But there was one person who didn’t see us as a burden — Mrs. Balogun, my mother’s beloved younger cousin and closest friend. She and her husband didn’t hesitate. They opened their arms and their home and took us in as their own.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time, they already had four children — two boys and twin girls — living in a modest room and parlor with another sibling also staying with them. That made nine of us under one roof. But not once did they complain or flinch. Instead, they loved louder, gave more, and somehow made space where there was none.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mrs. Balogun sold vegetables and okro at Oju Ore market. She woke early to buy and prepare goods, while I stepped into a new role — family cook and caretaker — at a very young age. I woke early to cook for everyone, went to school, came back to cook again. That’s where my leadership skills and resilience were born. Name any Yoruba soup — I could make it.
    </p>

    <p>
      Mr. Balogun was a man who cherished education, and he believed in me fiercely. He saw my passion for learning, celebrated my results, and made a powerful gesture of support — he paid my WAEC exam fee in full. That belief pushed me to work even harder. I burned candles at night, studied tirelessly, and passed my WAEC with pride. I didn’t want to disappoint the man who believed in my future.
    </p>

    <p>
      But life, again, brought heartbreak. Not long after my WAEC results, Mr. Balogun passed away. The weight of the entire family fell on my aunt’s shoulders. I couldn’t let her carry it alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I stepped up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I sold vegetables in the market beside her. I made bulk deliveries to schools like The Bells — walking long distances with sacks of okro and bunches of vegetables on my head. I still remember the day I collapsed from exhaustion in front of those polished, well-fed students. A student ran to help me up, and I smiled through the pain. That moment, too, built me.
    </p>

    <p>
      My aunt never let the family slip — no matter how hard it got. She kept the lights on, the kids in school, the meals coming. Even when I wanted to leave to chase greener pastures, she resisted — not out of control, but out of pure love and fear for our safety. She just wanted us all to be okay.
    </p>

    <p>
      Eventually, I left home to work, but I never left her behind. I started contributing — paying her rent, funding the twins’ education, and later setting up an herbal shop for her, a dream she once whispered to me. I even brought her firstborn to stay with me. We had become a family by choice, by love, and by destiny.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      “They gave me a roof, a family, a second chance at life — and I will never forget.”
    </p>

    <p>
      We lost her 4 years ago. But her strength lives on in me. Everything I do to uplift others — every plate of food served, every child supported, every voice amplified — carries the memory and the spirit of Mr. and Mrs. Balogun.
