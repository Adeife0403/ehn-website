    <p>
      My mother was the best thing that ever happened to me.
      She was more than a parent ‚Äî she was my protector, my provider, my teacher, and my spiritual light.
    </p>

    <p>
      After surviving domestic violence, she made the courageous decision to walk away and raise us on her own. Though the world only allowed her to go with the youngest child, life eventually brought me and my brother back into her arms ‚Äî where we truly belonged.
    </p>

    <p>
      She welcomed us with open arms and gave everything she had, even when it wasn‚Äôt much. Through every hardship ‚Äî emotionally, financially, spiritually ‚Äî she never stopped giving. To us, and to everyone around her.
    </p>

    <p>
      She was a proud Celestial Church Prophetess, called not to seek gain, but to guide, heal, and support. People came to her for breakthrough prayers, for comfort, and for hope. She cooked large pots of food and shared with our neighbors, welcomed my friends like her own, and gave freely ‚Äî even when she had nothing left for herself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When sickness came, she fought through it with fasting and prayers, still putting us first. I remember times we ate rice with raw pepper because that was all we had ‚Äî yet she always found a way to make sure we ate well. She sold her clothes and jewelry so I could go back to school, so I could have a future. She never saw sacrifice as loss ‚Äî she always said:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">‚ÄúEverything I do is not for today ‚Äî it‚Äôs for tomorrow. You will reap it.‚Äù</p>

    <p>
      That tomorrow is now.
      And everything I am, everything I do with the Everyday Heroes Network, carries her love in it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In her final moments, I was right by her side. I was her strength, and she was mine. She held on to me until the end ‚Äî and even though she‚Äôs gone, her spirit never left.
    </p>

    <p>
      She is the foundation of my purpose.  
      She is the reason I believe in everyday heroes.  
      And she will forever be my guiding light.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      Rest well, Maami.  
      Your son is walking in your light. ü§ç
