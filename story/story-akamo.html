    <h1>Mr. S.O. Akamo ‚Äî The Principal Who Shaped My Future</h1>
    <p class="subhead">A tribute to education, discipline, and silent sacrifice</p>
  </header>

    <img src="images/akamo.jpg" alt="Mr. S.O. Akamo" class="story-image" />

    <p>
      Mr. S.O. Akamo, founder and proprietor of Victory Academy, Ota, was a no-nonsense, principled, and deeply committed educationist who shaped more than minds ‚Äî he shaped lives. Known for his fierce discipline and unwavering standards, he turned troubled or unfocused students into responsible, morally upright individuals. His school wasn‚Äôt just an academy ‚Äî it was a refinery for character.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was enrolled at Victory Academy through the support of a neighbor and school principal, Master Adebayo, who lived in the same compound as my mother. I joined with little more than hope and commitment, but soon, I caught Baba Akamo‚Äôs eye. My passion for learning and discipline made me one of his favorite students ‚Äî and he became one of the most important mentors in my life.
    </p>

    <p>
      He taught English and Literature like he was born for it ‚Äî eloquent, sharp, and with a depth that made you fall in love with the subjects. He checked every class, enforced order, and ensured academic standards never slipped. Yes ‚Äî the cane was always ready, but behind the strict exterior was a man deeply invested in his students‚Äô futures.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I lost my mother in SS1, I was devastated and certain that my education would end. But Baba Akamo stepped in.
    </p>

      "Excellence is Sacrifice."
    </p>

    <p>
      Without hesitation, he gave me a full scholarship ‚Äî not just for me, but for any student in his care going through hardship. He didn‚Äôt announce it, he didn‚Äôt seek praise ‚Äî he simply lived by the school‚Äôs motto: ‚ÄúExcellence is Sacrifice.‚Äù And he sacrificed, again and again, for us.
    </p>

    <p>
      He continued to encourage me, check my progress, and demand my best ‚Äî and I gave it. I made him proud with my WAEC results. But more than the grades, I carried his discipline, his principles, and his fierce belief in personal responsibility and critical thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      Baba Akamo wasn‚Äôt religious ‚Äî he was a realist, a man of nature, a deep thinker, and a writer who often criticized bad leadership and advocated for true change in Nigeria. His mind was as sharp as his discipline, and his legacy echoes through every student he mentored.
    </p>

    <p>
      He is now late, survived by three children, grandchildren ‚Äî and hundreds of students who proudly carry his teachings wherever they go.
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
      ‚ÄúThank you, Baba Akamo, for giving me a future when I had none. Your sacrifice was not in vain. I am one of your proud products. üåü‚Äù
