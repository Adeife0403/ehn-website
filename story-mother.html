        My mother was more than a caregiver—she was my guardian, my compass, and my quiet hero. She gave everything to make sure I had a chance at life she never had. Often without rest, often without recognition, she pressed on.
      </p>

      <p>
        She sold what little she had to put food on our table and never let her pain interrupt our joy. She believed in the power of goodness, faith, and hard work. Her hands were rough from years of sacrifice, yet every touch was soft with love.
      </p>

      <p>
        I watched her skip meals just to ensure I never went to bed hungry. She taught me humility through action, courage through silence, and hope through prayer. Her strength wasn’t loud—it was in the way she woke up each day and did what needed to be done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Today, everything I am and strive to be is because of her. This story, this journey—began with her love. She is, and will always be, my first and forever hero.
